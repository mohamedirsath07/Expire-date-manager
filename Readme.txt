Smart Food Expiry & Donation Hub
Problem: Millions throw away food for fear of expiry, but much is still safe to eat or could be donated.

Solution: Build a web app that scans receipts/fridge (OCR ML), tracks expiry (predictive modeling), and notifies users before waste. Match soon-to-expire food with donation centers in your region.

Tech: React UI, OCR/ML for label/receipt reading, database for food tracking, integration with local charity APIs. 
Product Expiration Tracking

Store extracted product data and expiry info in Firebase (Firestore/Realtime Database).

Display a dynamic list of products with expiry status and “days left” visualization.

User Alerts/Notifications

Notify users via push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging) or in-app alerts when products are near expiry—encourage donation or use.

Tech Stack Recommendations
Frontend (Web & Mobile):

React (web dashboard/interface)

React Native (mobile scanning/alerting)

Backend & Database:

Firebase Authentication (user accounts)

Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database (track products and expiry dates)

Firebase Cloud Functions (scheduled expiry checks and notifications)

Notifications:

Firebase Cloud Messaging for cross-platform push notifications

ML Libraries/Models
OCR:

Tesseract.js for in-browser OCR (works with React/React Native)

Optionally, Google Cloud Vision API for more accurate receipt parsing (paid, powerful, easier to use at scale)

Entity Extraction / Parsing:

Use Regex, string matching (for simple prototypes)

HuggingFace Transformers or spaCy (via a backend API or Cloud Function) for robust NER to auto-detect product names and quantity from noisy texts

Expiry Prediction / Lookup:

Local database of common grocery lifespans (mapped by product name)

Open Food Facts API for structured product metadata (including typical shelf life, when available)

APIs & Datasets
Open Food Facts API:
To fetch standardized product info, ingredient lists, and sometimes average shelf lives

Google Cloud Vision API:
For more sophisticated OCR, especially with non-standard receipts

Suggested User Flow
User takes photo or uploads image of bill via app.

Frontend sends image to backend (optional preprocess).

OCR processes image → raw text.

ML/NLP parses items, quantity, estimated/real expiration.

Each item stored with relevant metadata and expiry date in Firebase.

Firebase Cloud Function checks daily, sends alerts for soon-to-expire items.

Prompt for Generating Code
Here’s an example prompt you can use with a code generation AI (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Code Interpreter, etc.):

“Build a cross-platform (React/React Native) app for scanning grocery bills or receipts. Use OCR (Tesseract.js or Google Vision API) to extract text, then parse grocery product names, purchased quantity, and expiration date (if found).

If no expiry date, estimate using a static mapping of product types to shelf life. Store all extracted data to Firebase (FireStore). Notify users with in-app and push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging) a few days before each item’s expiry. List items in sorted order by days left in a dashboard. Assume image input via phone camera or file upload. Include commented code and basic error handling.”

You can adjust this prompt depending on whether you want code in JS, TypeScript, etc., and which ML library or API you prefer.

Final Tips
For the MVP, start with Tesseract.js for OCR—it’s free and works in-browser. Later, replace or supplement with Google Cloud Vision if accuracy on real-world bills is low.

Use Regex + Open Food Facts for quick, reliable product name detection before adding advanced ML NER.

Make your expiration notifications user-friendly: eg. “Milk expires in 2 days!”

Privacy: Remind users that their receipt/images are only used to power this feature and are stored securely.

This project will showcase end-to-end integration of ML, real-world OCR, cloud databases, and alert-driven UX—demonstrating high-impact, practical engineering skills.

Smart Food Expiry Reminder – Project Brief

Goal:
Minimize household food waste by empowering users to scan shopping bills/receipts, automatically extract product details (via OCR and ML models), estimate or fetch expiration dates, store in a cloud database, and notify users before food expires.

Core Components & Flow:

Receipt/Bill Scanning

User uploads or snaps a picture via React (web) or React Native (app).

OCR & Data Extraction

Use OCR (e.g., Tesseract.js) to extract text.

Use ML or rule-based methods (Regex, NLP) to parse item names and expiration info.

Product Expiry Tracking

Store data in Firebase. Visualize items and days left.

Notifications

Use Firebase Cloud Messaging for alerts before expiry.

Tech Stack:

React/React Native (UI)

Firebase (DB, Authentication, Cloud Functions, FCM)

OCR: Tesseract.js or Google Cloud Vision API

ML/NLP: Regex, Open Food Facts API, possible spaCy/HuggingFace for advanced parsing

Suggested Prompt for Code Generation:

"Build a cross-platform (React/React Native) app for scanning grocery bills or receipts. Use OCR (Tesseract.js or Google Vision API) to extract text, then parse grocery product names, purchased quantity, and expiration date (if found). If no expiry date, estimate using a static mapping of product types to shelf life. Store all extracted data to Firebase. Notify users with in-app and push notifications a few days before each item's expiry. List items in sorted order by days left in a dashboard. Assume image input via phone camera or file upload. Include commented code and basic error handling."

Tips:

Start with Tesseract.js for free OCR.

Use Regex/Open Food Facts before advanced ML for item detection.

Make notifications clear and actionable.

Ensure data privacy and user trust.
